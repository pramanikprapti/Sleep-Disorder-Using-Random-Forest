# Sleep Disorder Prediction Using Random Forest
A machine learning project for predicting sleep disorders using a Random Forest classifier on physiological and lifestyle data. The model provides automated, data-driven identification of sleep disorder risks to support health analysis and early intervention.


## Project Overview
This project predicts sleep disorders using a Random Forest classifier, leveraging health and lifestyle data to accurately identify risks such as insomnia and sleep apnea. The tool provides an automated and non-invasive method to support health monitoring and early intervention.

## Features
- Machine learning-based sleep disorder detection
- Uses Random Forest classification
- Data-driven risk prediction for conditions like insomnia and sleep apnea
- Supports reproducible experiment workflows

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/sleep-disorder-random-forest.git
   ```
2. Set up a Python environment. Recommended:
   ```
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

- Prepare input dataset according to data specifications.
- Run the main training and prediction script:
   ```
   python train.py
   ```
- Results, predictions, and model metrics are saved .
